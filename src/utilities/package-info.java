/**
 * The {@code utilities} package defines interfaces and supporting utility
 * components used across the application.
 *
 * <p>This includes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code BSTreeADT} – The Abstract Data Type interface describing required
 *       Binary Search Tree operations such as insertion, searching, size, height,
 *       and traversal.</li>
 *
 *   <li>{@code Iterator} – A simplified iterator interface used by the BST
 *       traversal methods.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These interfaces ensure the BST implementation follows a consistent public
 * API independent of internal data structure design.
